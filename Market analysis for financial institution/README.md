- Marketing Analysis amone financial institution
   - Background: Due to the increase of marketing campaigns, it is important to forecast the suitable advertising strategy that targets the appropriate demographic. as of January 12th, 2021, according to Wikipedia.The sole reason that 97.4% of the products are being sold is because of financial institutions' marketing initiatives.The budget and duration of the campaign should be estimated in accordance withthe different campaign types using an interactive dashboard.
   - Tools : R programming, R shiny, Tidyverse
   - Dataset: With a dataset like the "Bank Marketing Dataset" from the "UCI Machine Learning dataset," we intend to create an interactive web dashboard.Increased visualization of the needed information. This dataset's nearly 45k instances make it incredibly helpful. That will suffice to complete the task.

- Goal:
    - To effectively visualize the marketing trend.
    - Examine the demographics of each campaign's audience.
    - Projection of all pertinent future trends.
    - Foreseeing the modification of patterns (If any).
 - Methods:
     - We initially intend to clean the data in the necessary format, which in this instance will take the shape of a "Tibble"
     - You can accomplish that by utilizing "Tidyverse" and "readr". Using tidyverse, you can complete any other task, including gathering, sorting, scattering, and so on.
     - The “ggplot” package is sufficient for interactive data visualization, however “rshiny” must be used as part of our project to create a webpage..
     - We also use the "Lubridate" package to handle date-and-time data.
