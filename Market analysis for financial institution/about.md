The information relates to direct marketing activities run by a Portuguese bank. On phone conversations, the marketing campaigns were based. In order to determine if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed ('yes') or not ('no'), it was frequently necessary to make more than one contact with the same client.

**1. Overview**


  **1.1 Background**
          Due to the increase of marketing campaigns, it is important to forecast the suitable advertising strategy              that targets the appropriate demographic. as of January 12th, 2021, according to Wikipedia.
          The sole reason that 97.4% of the products are being sold is because of financial institutions' marketing              initiatives.
          The budget and duration of the campaign should be estimated in accordance with the different campaign
          types using an interactive dashboard.
     
  **1.2 Dataset**
          With a dataset like the "Bank Marketing Dataset" from the "UCI Machine Learning dataset," we intend to create           an interactive web dashboard.
          Increased visualization of the needed information. This dataset's nearly 45k instances make it incredibly              helpful. That will suffice to complete the task.
          
  **1.3 Goal**
          1) To effectively visualize the marketing trend.
          2) Examine the demographics of each campaign's audience.
          3)Projection of all pertinent future trends.
          4)Foreseeing the modification of patterns (If any)

   We initially intend to clean the data in the necessary format, which in this instance will take the shape of           a "Tibble"
   You can accomplish that by utilizing "Tidyverse" and "readr". Using tidyverse, you can complete any other              task, including gathering, sorting, scattering, and so on.
   The “ggplot” package is sufficient for interactive data visualization, however “rshiny” must be used as part           of our project to create a webpage.
   We also use the "Lubridate" package to handle date-and-time data.
